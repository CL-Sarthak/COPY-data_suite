# Modularization Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap provides a practical, incremental approach to modularizing the codebase without disrupting ongoing development. The plan is designed to be implemented over 6-8 weeks with minimal risk.

## Priority Ranking

### High Priority (Weeks 1-2)
These provide immediate value and establish patterns:

1. **Shared Component Library**
   - Extract common UI patterns
   - Establish component conventions
   - High reuse potential

2. **Custom Hooks Library**
   - Extract data fetching logic
   - Standardize error handling
   - Improve testability

3. **API Service Layer**
   - Centralize API calls
   - Add request/response typing
   - Enable easier mocking

### Medium Priority (Weeks 3-4)
Core features with highest complexity:

4. **Synthetic Data Module**
   - Most complex feature (1926 lines)
   - Clear sub-features
   - Good proof of concept

5. **Discovery Module**
   - File upload complexity
   - Data source management
   - Clear boundaries

### Lower Priority (Weeks 5-6)
Can be done incrementally:

6. **Redaction Module**
   - Pattern management
   - Annotation system
   - ML integration

7. **Catalog Management**
   - Field mapping
   - Category management
   - Already partially modular

## Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Establish patterns and shared components

```
Tasks:
□ Create features/ directory structure
□ Create shared/components/ with:
  - Modal.tsx
  - Button.tsx
  - Panel.tsx
  - LoadingState.tsx
  - ErrorState.tsx
  - EmptyState.tsx
□ Create shared/hooks/ with:
  - useAPI.ts
  - useLoading.ts
  - useModal.ts
□ Document component patterns
□ Add Storybook for component library (optional)
```

### Week 2: Service Layer
**Goal**: Centralize API communication

```
Tasks:
□ Create core/api/ structure
□ Extract API calls from pages to services:
  - syntheticAPI.ts
  - dataSourceAPI.ts
  - patternAPI.ts
□ Add TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
□ Create error handling utilities
□ Add request interceptors for auth/logging
```

### Week 3: First Feature Module
**Goal**: Modularize Synthetic Data feature

```
Tasks:
□ Create features/synthetic/ structure
□ Extract configuration components
□ Extract job management components
□ Create feature-specific hooks
□ Migrate modals to separate components
□ Update page.tsx to use new structure
□ Add tests for new components
```

### Week 4: Second Feature Module
**Goal**: Modularize Discovery feature

```
Tasks:
□ Create features/discovery/ structure
□ Extract data source components
□ Extract file upload logic
□ Create transformation components
□ Implement new modal patterns
□ Update page.tsx
□ Add integration tests
```

### Week 5: Third Feature Module
**Goal**: Modularize Redaction feature

```
Tasks:
□ Create features/redaction/ structure
□ Extract pattern components
□ Extract annotation logic
□ Create detection components
□ Migrate feedback system
□ Update page.tsx
□ Ensure ML integration works
```

### Week 6: Optimization & Cleanup
**Goal**: Performance and polish

```
Tasks:
□ Implement code splitting
□ Add lazy loading for features
□ Remove duplicate code
□ Update documentation
□ Performance testing
□ Team training on new patterns
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. File Naming Conventions
```
Components: PascalCase.tsx
Hooks: camelCase.ts (start with 'use')
Services: camelCase.ts
Types: camelCase.types.ts
Tests: [name].test.tsx
```

### 2. Component Structure
```typescript
// features/[feature]/components/[Component]/index.tsx
export { ComponentName } from './ComponentName';
export { ComponentNameContainer } from './ComponentNameContainer';
export type { ComponentNameProps } from './ComponentName.types';
```

### 3. Import Paths
```typescript
// Use absolute imports with aliases
import { Button } from '@/shared/components';
import { useAPI } from '@/shared/hooks';
import { SyntheticAPI } from '@/features/synthetic/services';
```

### 4. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all hooks
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for feature modules
- E2E tests remain at page level

## Success Metrics

### Week 2 Checkpoint
- [ ] 10+ shared components extracted
- [ ] 5+ custom hooks created
- [ ] API service layer established
- [ ] 0 regressions in existing functionality

### Week 4 Checkpoint
- [ ] 2 features fully modularized
- [ ] 50% reduction in largest file sizes
- [ ] Test coverage increased by 20%
- [ ] Build time unchanged or improved

### Week 6 Checkpoint
- [ ] All major features modularized
- [ ] Average file size < 300 lines
- [ ] 80% test coverage
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Feature Flags
```typescript
// Enable gradual rollout
const useModularSynthetic = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MODULAR_SYNTHETIC === 'true';

export default function SyntheticPage() {
  return useModularSynthetic ? <SyntheticFeature /> : <LegacySyntheticPage />;
}
```

### 2. Incremental Migration
- Keep old code until new code is tested
- Run both in parallel during transition
- A/B test if needed

### 3. Rollback Plan
- Git tags at each major milestone
- Feature flags for quick disable
- Keep legacy code for 2 weeks after migration

## Team Considerations

### Training Needed
1. Component patterns workshop
2. Custom hooks best practices
3. Testing strategies
4. Code review guidelines

### Communication Plan
1. Weekly progress updates
2. Pattern documentation in wiki
3. Pair programming for knowledge transfer
4. Brown bag sessions for major changes

## Long-term Vision

### Phase 2 (Months 2-3)
- Micro-frontend architecture evaluation
- Module federation for true isolation
- Independent deployment capabilities

### Phase 3 (Months 4-6)
- Component library package
- Shared across multiple projects
- Open source potential

## Getting Started

1. Review and approve this roadmap
2. Set up feature branch: `feature/modularization-phase-1`
3. Create initial directory structure
4. Begin with shared components
5. Daily standups during implementation

## Questions to Address

1. Should we use a state management library (Redux, Zustand)?
2. Do we need a component library (Storybook, Bit)?
3. Should we implement CSS modules or stick with Tailwind?
4. What's our browser support requirement?
5. Do we need server-side rendering for all features?

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a practical path to modernizing our codebase. By following this incremental approach, we can improve maintainability without disrupting feature development. The key is to start small, establish patterns, and gradually expand the modular architecture across the application.
