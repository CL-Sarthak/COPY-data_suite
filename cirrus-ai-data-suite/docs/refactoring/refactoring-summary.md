# Refactoring Summary

## Completed Refactorings

### 1. Dashboard Component ✅
- **Original**: 623 lines (single file)
- **Refactored**: 7 files totaling ~450 lines
- **Key improvements**: Service layer, custom hooks, modular components

### 2. DataSourceTable Component ✅
- **Original**: 849 lines (single file)
- **Refactored**: 11 files totaling ~800 lines
- **Key improvements**: Separated logic, state, and UI; reusable components

### 3. CatalogManager Component ✅
- **Original**: 1,347 lines (single file)
- **Refactored**: 12 files totaling ~1,800 lines
- **Key improvements**: Service layer, custom hooks, focused UI components

## Patterns Established

1. **Service Layer Pattern**
   - Separates API calls and business logic
   - Provides clean, testable interfaces
   - Handles error cases consistently

2. **Custom Hooks Pattern**
   - Manages component state
   - Wraps service calls with UI feedback
   - Provides reusable state logic

3. **Component Modularity**
   - Each component has a single responsibility
   - Props interfaces for type safety
   - Focused, reusable UI components

4. **Type Safety**
   - Centralized type definitions
   - Full TypeScript coverage
   - Proper interface definitions

## Next Components to Refactor

Based on file size analysis:

1. **FieldMappingInterface.tsx** (1,196 lines)
   - Complex mapping logic
   - Multiple modals and state
   - Good candidate for service extraction

2. **DataAnnotation.tsx** (1,183 lines)
   - Pattern detection logic
   - Feedback system
   - Complex state management

3. **FileUpload.tsx** (580 lines)
   - Upload logic
   - Progress tracking
   - Error handling

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability**: Code is organized and easy to find
2. **Testability**: Each piece can be tested in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Components and hooks can be shared
4. **Performance**: Better code splitting potential
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear structure and patterns

## Migration Strategy

For each component:
1. Create type definitions
2. Extract services for API/business logic
3. Create custom hooks for state management
4. Break down UI into focused components
5. Update imports in consuming components
6. Test thoroughly before removing old code
