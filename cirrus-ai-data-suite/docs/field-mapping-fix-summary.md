# Field Mapping Fix Summary

## Issue
When users mapped fields (e.g., "Name" → "Full name"), the transformed data preview was not showing the mapped field names. Instead, it displayed the original field names.

## Root Cause
The transform endpoint (`/api/data-sources/[id]/transform/route.ts`) was overwriting field-mapped data when called after the apply-mappings operation. This happened because the endpoint would save its transformation result back to the database without checking if field mappings had already been applied.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Transform Endpoint (line 316-322)
Added a check for `transformationAppliedAt` to prevent overwriting field-mapped data:

```typescript
// Only save if this is the first transformation (not field-mapped data)
if (!entity?.transformedData && !entity?.transformationAppliedAt && catalog.totalRecords > 0) {
  // Save logic...
}
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging
- Added logging to track when field-mapped data is detected
- Added logging to show why transformation save is skipped
- Helps with debugging and monitoring the fix

### 3. Created Debug Endpoint
Created `/api/test/field-mapping-debug` endpoint to help diagnose field mapping issues:
- Shows current state of transformedData
- Displays field mappings
- Indicates whether transform endpoint would overwrite data

### 4. Created Integration Test
Added test to verify field-mapped data is preserved when transform endpoint is called.

## How the Fix Works

1. **Apply Mappings**: When user applies field mappings, the system:
   - Transforms field names correctly
   - Saves transformed data as an array
   - Sets `transformationAppliedAt` timestamp

2. **Transform Endpoint**: When called after field mappings:
   - Detects existing `transformationAppliedAt`
   - Skips saving to avoid overwriting field-mapped data
   - Still returns properly formatted response

3. **Preview Display**: The preview now correctly shows:
   - Field-mapped names when available
   - Falls back to transform endpoint only when needed
   - Preserves user's field name mappings

## Testing the Fix

1. Upload a CSV file with fields like "Name", "Email"
2. Map fields: "Name" → "Full name", "Email" → "Email Address"
3. Click "Apply Mappings"
4. View the transformed data preview
5. Field names should show as "Full name" and "Email Address"

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/api/data-sources/[id]/transform/route.ts` - Added check to prevent overwriting
2. `/src/hooks/useTransformedPreview.ts` - Fixed linting issue
3. `/src/app/api/test/field-mapping-debug/route.ts` - Created debug endpoint
4. `/src/__tests__/integration/field-mapping-flow.test.ts` - Added integration test

## Deployment Notes

- No database migrations required
- Backward compatible with existing data
- Safe to deploy to production
- Monitor logs for "Checking if should save transformation" messages
