# Test Documentation Update Summary

## Date: January 24, 2025

## Overview

- Updated Scripts section with all test-related commands
- Added reference to Smoke Tests Guide

### 2. **docs/SMOKE_TESTS_GUIDE.md**
- Updated to reflect three different smoke test runners
- Added detailed test coverage breakdown with specifics
- Clarified the different runner scripts and their use cases
- Added information about TypeScript runner, JS runner, and quick smoke script

### 3. **ARCHITECTURE.md**
- Added comprehensive Testing Strategy section
- Documented three test types: Unit, Integration, and Smoke
- Included details about test infrastructure and runners
- Added smoke test environment variable (`isSmokeTest`)

### 4. **CLAUDE.md**
- Updated smoke test backlog item to show COMPLETED status
- Added detailed completion information
- Added Test Documentation section with reference to new TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md

### 5. **.env.example**
- Added TESTING CONFIGURATION section
- Included SMOKE_TEST_URL and SMOKE_TEST_AUTH_TOKEN variables
- Provided defaults and descriptions

### 6. **.gitignore**
- Added `/test-results` to ignore smoke test result files

## New Documentation Created

### **docs/TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md**
A comprehensive testing guide that consolidates:
- All test types (unit, integration, smoke)
- Complete command reference
- Configuration files and their purposes
- Environment variables
- Best practices for each test type
- CI/CD integration examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Test maintenance guidelines

## Key Information Documented

### Test Commands Summary
```bash
# Unit Tests
npm run test                    # Run unit tests
npm run test:watch             # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage          # With coverage

# Integration Tests  
npm run test:integration       # Run integration tests
npm run test:integration:watch # Watch mode

# Smoke Tests
npm run test:smoke             # TypeScript runner (recommended)
npm run test:smoke:ci          # Jest CI mode
npm run smoke                  # Quick verification script
npm run smoke:local            # Test localhost
npm run smoke:prod             # Test production
```

### Smoke Test Infrastructure
1. **Jest-based test suite** - 7 comprehensive test files
2. **TypeScript runner** - Orchestrates Jest with health checks
3. **JavaScript runner** - Alternative Jest orchestrator  
4. **Quick smoke script** - Standalone verification without Jest

### Environment Detection
- Local vs deployed test handling
- Automatic test skipping based on environment
- Support for authentication tokens

## Consistency Improvements

1. **Removed outdated references** to non-existent test commands
2. **Aligned all documentation** with actual package.json scripts
3. **Clarified the purpose** of each test runner script
4. **Added missing configuration details** for smoke tests
5. **Created central test documentation** to avoid duplication

## Recommendations for Future Updates

1. Keep TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md as the single source of truth for testing
2. Update test documentation when adding new test types or commands
3. Document any environment-specific test behaviors
4. Add examples when implementing new test patterns
5. Update CI/CD examples when deployment process changes

## Notes

- All documentation now accurately reflects the current state of the codebase
- The smoke test suite is comprehensive and well-documented
- Multiple runner options provide flexibility for different use cases
- Environment-aware testing ensures tests work across all deployments
