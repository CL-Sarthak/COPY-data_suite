# Metadata Context & Global Querying Session Notes

## Session Overview
**Date**: July 14, 2025
**Branch**: feature/metadata-context
**Objective**: Enable natural language queries across all datasets with rich contextual understanding

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Keywords/Subject Section in Data Discovery
- Added visual display of AI-generated keywords for each data source
- Shows when keywords were last generated with relative time
- "Generate Keywords" button for sources without keywords
- Keywords update without page refresh (fixed awkward reload)
- Keywords displayed as blue badges in expandable data source details

### 2. Fixed PII Query Not Including Database Sources
- **Initial Problem**: Query "What data sources contain PII?" wasn't including the Patients database
- **Root Cause**: QueryContextService wasn't checking aiKeywords field when filtering data sources
- **Solution**: Updated QueryContextService to:
  - Include aiKeywords in the filtering logic
  - Implement bidirectional keyword matching (query→keyword and keyword→query)
  - Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Final Fix**: Updated Patients database summary to explicitly mention PII/PHI and regenerated keywords

### 3. Technical Implementation Details

#### Files Modified:
- `/src/components/dataSourceTable/DataSourceDetails.tsx` - Added Keywords/Subject section UI
- `/src/types/discovery.ts` - Updated DataSource interface (aiKeywords as string)
- `/src/services/dataSourceService.ts` - Added keyword fields to getAllDataSources and getDataSourceById
- `/src/services/queryContextService.ts` - Fixed keyword matching in getRelevantContext
- `/src/app/api/data-sources/[id]/keywords/route.ts` - New endpoint for fetching keywords
- `/src/services/keywordGenerationService.ts` - Fixed configuration serialization issue

#### Debug Tools Created:
- `/api/debug/keywords` - Shows all data source keywords and parsing
- `/api/test/keyword-matching` - Tests query keyword extraction and matching
- `/api/admin/regenerate-db-keywords` - Force regenerates keywords for all databases

### 4. Current State of Global Query Feature

#### Working:
- Natural language queries successfully translate to structured queries
- Query routing based on keywords works correctly
- PII queries now properly include all relevant data sources
- Table-level joins within single data sources
- Field resolution for joined queries
- LLM integration with retry logic for 529 errors

#### Completed Phases:
1. ✅ Data Source Summaries (July 9, 2025)
2. ✅ Table-Level Summaries (July 9, 2025)
3. ✅ Field Annotations (July 10, 2025)
4. ✅ Global Query Interface - Basic functionality (July 11, 2025)

#### Still Needs Work:
- Multi-source query logic for legitimate related sources
- Further testing with various data combinations
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### 5. Important Implementation Notes

#### Keyword Storage:
- Keywords stored as JSON string in `aiKeywords` column
- Must parse JSON when reading: `JSON.parse(ds.aiKeywords)`
- Keywords generated by LLM based on data source content and metadata

#### Query Processing Flow:
1. User enters natural language query
2. QueryContextService extracts keywords and filters relevant data sources
3. Context passed to LLM for query generation
4. LLM generates structured query based on available data
5. Query executed against relevant data sources

#### Key Fixes Applied:
- Removed all specialized data handling (no more creditScore/patient specific code)
- Removed excessive logging except LLM interactions
- Fixed database imports to create table metadata and keywords
- Added retry logic for Anthropic 529 (overloaded) errors

### 6. Known Issues Resolved

1. **Credit score query failing** - Fixed by properly saving transformedData
2. **Query only processing 1000 rows** - Fixed by removing temporary limits
3. **Database sources not in queries** - Fixed by adding keyword generation
4. **Page refresh on keyword generation** - Fixed with AJAX update

### 7. Testing Recommendations

To verify everything works:
1. Check `/api/debug/keywords` to see all keywords
2. Try query "What data sources contain PII?"
3. Verify it includes: Financial Dataset, Medical Information.pdf, and patients database
4. Test other natural language queries for proper routing

### 8. Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **Enhanced Keyword Management UI**
   - Allow manual addition/removal of keywords
   - Bulk keyword operations
   - Keyword suggestions based on data content

2. **Multi-Source Query Joins**
   - Enable joining across related data sources
   - Relationship detection between sources
   - Query optimization for cross-source joins

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Caching for query context
   - Streaming for large result sets
   - Query result pagination

## Environment Details
- Branch: feature/metadata-context
- Last commit: Added debug tools for keyword matching investigation
