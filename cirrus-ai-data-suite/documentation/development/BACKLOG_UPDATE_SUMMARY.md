# Backlog Update Summary

## Overview
The backlog has been updated to reflect the gaps identified from the medical research use case analysis and reprioritized to focus on core functionality over compliance features (since LockThreat integration will handle compliance).

## New High Priority Items Added

### 1. Large-Scale Data Processing Architecture (Critical)
- Support for >1TB datasets with distributed processing
- Essential for medical research and enterprise use cases
- Includes Spark/Dask integration and horizontal scaling

### 2. Enhanced Batch Processing API (Critical)
- High-performance batch API for AIOps integration
- Bulk data processing endpoints with async job management
- Critical for the continuous ML model training pipeline

### 3. Medical Data Standards Support (High)
- HL7/FHIR parsing and transformation
- DICOM metadata extraction
- Medical terminology mapping (SNOMED CT, ICD-10, LOINC)
- Essential for healthcare data integration

### 4. Healthcare System Integrations (High)
- Epic and Cerner connectors
- FHIR server integration
- HL7 interface engine
- Seamless healthcare data source connectivity

### 5. Medical Research Workflow Templates (Medium)
- Clinical trial data templates
- Patient cohort building tools
- Research protocol management
- Accelerates medical research projects

## Key Changes to Existing Items

### Promoted to Higher Priority:
- **Streaming Data Support**: Moved from Medium to Critical priority
- **Background Job Processing**: Moved from Medium to High priority
- **API Integrations**: Enhanced with specific healthcare focus
- **Export Enhancements**: Focused on ML pipeline formats

### Modified for Core Functionality:
- **Contextual Sensitivity Levels**: Refocused on environment-based redaction (dev/staging/prod) rather than compliance
- **Domain-Specific Pattern Libraries**: Emphasized medical patterns
- **Advanced Generation Templates**: Added medical research templates

### Moved to Low Priority (LockThreat Integration):
- **Audit Trail System**: Will integrate with LockThreat
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Will use LockThreat's RBAC
- **Compliance Monitoring Dashboard**: Handled by LockThreat
- **Data Subject Request Management**: LockThreat feature
- **Privacy Impact Assessment**: LockThreat module

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1 (Next 2 months) - Core Infrastructure:
1. Large-Scale Data Processing Architecture
2. Streaming Data Support
3. Enhanced Batch Processing API
4. Background Job Processing

### Phase 2 (Following 2 months) - Medical Focus:
1. Medical Data Standards Support
2. Healthcare System Integrations
3. Medical Research Workflow Templates
4. Domain-Specific Pattern Libraries (medical focus)

### Phase 3 (Subsequent months) - Enhancement:
1. Unified Search & Query Engine
2. Virtual Data Lake Features
3. Enhanced Discovery UI
4. Advanced Generation Templates

## Impact on Medical Research Use Case

With these updates, the platform will support:
- ✅ Processing >1TB medical datasets
- ✅ Parsing disparate healthcare data formats
- ✅ Environment-based redaction levels
- ✅ Continuous AIOps pipeline integration
- ✅ High-performance batch processing
- ✅ Medical-specific patterns and workflows

The reprioritized backlog now directly addresses all critical gaps for the medical research use case while deferring compliance features to the LockThreat integration.
