# Annotation Interface Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JSON Files Not Showing in Annotation
**Problem**: JSON files were returning raw data objects instead of properly formatted UnifiedDataRecord objects.

**Fix**: Updated `/src/app/api/data-sources/[id]/transform/route.ts` to ensure JSON-only data sources still return properly formatted records:
- Each JSON array item is wrapped in a UnifiedDataRecord with proper metadata
- Single JSON objects are also wrapped correctly
- This ensures the annotation interface can properly parse and display the data

### 2. Text Transposition in Pattern Highlighting  
**Problem**: When highlighting patterns, text was being transposed due to incorrect HTML escaping position calculations.

**Fix**: Rewrote the highlighting logic in `/src/components/DataAnnotation.tsx`:
- Process content in segments from end to beginning
- Escape HTML for each segment individually
- Avoid position calculation errors from HTML entity length differences

### 3. Multiple Documents Showing for Single File
**Problem**: JSON arrays were creating one "document" per array item in the annotation interface.

**Fix**: Updated `/src/app/redaction/page.tsx` AnnotationWrapper to:
- Group records by source file name
- Create one FileData object per source file
- Combine JSON array records into a single readable document
- Properly handle PDFs and other document types

### 4. CSV File Duplication on Re-upload
**Problem**: Re-uploading the same CSV file would append it instead of replacing.

**Fix**: Previously fixed in discovery page with proper file deduplication using a Map to ensure unique filenames.

## Test Instructions

1. Upload the test JSON file (`test-annotation-data.json`) in Data Discovery
2. Go to Pattern Definition and click "Annotate Data" on the uploaded source
3. Verify:
   - JSON data displays as a single document with all 3 records
   - No text transposition when patterns are highlighted
   - Pattern highlighting works correctly
   - Only one document appears in the document selector

### 5. Large Dataset Performance Issues
**Problem**: Loading all records from large datasets made the annotation interface unresponsive.

**Fix**: Implemented pagination to load only 10 records at a time:
- Added pagination parameters to `/api/data-sources/[id]/transform` API
- Added Previous/Next navigation controls in the annotation interface
- Show current page and total record count
- Include helpful tip that patterns apply to the entire dataset
- Skip pagination when viewing full catalog in discovery
