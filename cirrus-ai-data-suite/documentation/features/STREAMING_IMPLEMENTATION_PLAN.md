# Streaming Data Support Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement streaming data support to handle large datasets (>1TB) efficiently without memory constraints.

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Streaming File Upload
- Chunked file upload with resumability
- Progress tracking with real-time updates
- Support for pause/resume functionality
- Automatic chunk verification and retry

### 2. Stream Processing Pipeline
- Node.js streams for memory-efficient processing
- Backpressure handling to prevent memory overflow
- Transform streams for data processing
- Pipeline composition for complex workflows

### 3. Storage Integration
- Stream directly to external storage (S3, Vercel Blob)
- Avoid loading entire files into memory
- Support for multipart uploads
- Concurrent chunk processing

### 4. API Enhancements
- Streaming endpoints for large file uploads
- Server-Sent Events for progress updates
- Chunked response streaming for downloads
- WebSocket support for bidirectional streaming

### 5. UI Components
- Upload progress indicator with pause/resume
- Real-time processing status
- Memory usage monitoring
- Error recovery interface

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Streaming Infrastructure
1. Create streaming upload endpoint
2. Implement chunk management system
3. Add resumable upload support
4. Create streaming storage adapters

### Phase 2: Processing Pipeline
1. Implement transform streams for data processing
2. Add backpressure handling
3. Create pipeline composition system
4. Add progress tracking

### Phase 3: UI Integration
1. Create streaming upload component
2. Add progress visualization
3. Implement pause/resume controls
4. Add error recovery UI

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
1. Test with large files (>1GB)
2. Optimize chunk sizes
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Handle edge cases

## Technical Approach

### Upload Flow
```
Client → Chunked Upload → Stream Processing → External Storage
         ↓                ↓                   ↓
    Progress SSE     Transform Stream    Direct Streaming
```

### Key Technologies
- Node.js Streams API
- Multer for multipart uploads
- SSE for progress updates
- External storage SDKs with streaming support

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Can upload files >1GB without memory issues
- ✅ Processing doesn't block other operations
- ✅ Resume interrupted uploads
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking
- ✅ Efficient memory usage (<500MB for any file size)
