# TypeScript Fixes Summary

## Issue
The app wasn't loading due to TypeScript compilation errors that prevented the build process.

## Root Causes

1. **DataSourceConfig type mismatch**: The code was trying to set a `name` property on `DataSourceConfig` which doesn't exist in the type definition.

2. **Missing file size property**: The transform route was accessing `jsonFile.size` but the type definition didn't include the `size` property.

3. **Redundant type check**: A comparison between `newSourceType` and 'filesystem' in a code path where they could never be equal.

4. **Missing type annotations**: forEach callbacks were missing type annotations for their parameters.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Added separate state for source name** (`/src/app/discovery/page.tsx`):
   - Added `newSourceName` state variable
   - Updated all references from `newSourceConfig.name` to `newSourceName`
   - Reset `newSourceName` when closing modals

2. **Fixed file type definition** (`/src/app/api/data-sources/[id]/transform/route.ts`):
   - Updated type to include `size: number` property

3. **Removed redundant check** (`/src/app/discovery/page.tsx`):
   - Removed unnecessary `if (newSourceType !== 'filesystem')` check in non-filesystem code path

4. **Added type annotations** (`/src/app/redaction/page.tsx`):
   - Added `typeof firstRecord` type for record parameter
   - Added `number` type for index parameter

## Result
The app now compiles successfully and the development server starts without errors.
